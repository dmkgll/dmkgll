title: KYC critical mass in Bitcoin

Speculation. KYC "critical mass" is when the economic majority—maybe
70% or more—of Bitcoin users are KYCd. Many people
think this is not a problem because the privacy malpractice of others
is not your concern. That is not true.

Two things might happen. The first is that the reduced privacy set will make it
easier for chainanalysis to identify people who aren't KYCd. 

The next and much scarier thing is that Bitcoin
addresses that have not been KYCd will be tracked, traced, marked,
even blacklisted. Governments will get away with this
because the economic majority who are already KYCd will not be
affected by it and may even want people to be known like they are.

What began as something good—the fact that you properly managed your
on-chain privacy—turns into a kind of Scarlet Letter attatched to
your coins. It's an odd thought—that doing things to make your coins
more fungible can literally be used to make them less fungible—but it makes sense. You just reverse your thinking.
People typically think of KYC as something that reduces fungibility because it does. But governments
can just as easily declare the opposite and say that *only* KYC coins are legally fungible. The others
are colored, marked.

"So? Who is going to stop me from sending my funds peer-to-peer?" Good
 question. The government will. They can do this in several ways. 

More directly, they can issue "do-not-mine" orders to miners in an
attempt to prevent them from processing transactions from addresses
that aren't identified. This may or may not work. Less directly, they
can pass legislation that holds businesses or individuals liable for
doing business with addresses that have not been identified. This
would essentially cut you off from the mainstream economy. Similarly, they can pass
know-your-transaction legislation that requires people who receive or send funds
to an unidentified address to identify it. People will face high, bureacratic costs
to transacting with you fines, legal trouble, or worse. They don't need to stop
your transactions *technically* in order to effectively limit your
ability to use your Bitcoins as you want. If they can mark your coins,
they can censor them.

This might even be done socially, with the State playing only a marginal role. It strikes me that we are already
most of the way there. If people are conditioned to believe that
private coins=criminal coins, or private coins=racist coins, or private coins="anything I don't like", they will refuse to receive private coins, punish  or ostracise
people who did receive private coins (it is on-chain literally *forever*), or
actively participate in their identification when its socially advantageous to do so,
much like doxxing+cancellation works today. 

Obviously there are exceptions to this or ways to reduce its effect. And maybe off-chain
transactions will solve a lot of this concern. Maybe improvements to
the privacy of Bitcoin layer 1 will make KYC less of a problem (I doubt it). Maybe
miners, businesses and corporate structures will decentralise to the
point where they don't have a single point of failure that the
government can blackmail against accepting coins without KYC (also doubt it). Maybe,
God-willing, all the exchanges will go "poof" and disappear, so that
people will stop entering the Bitcoin economy through regulated, KYC
channels and we will never reach KYC critical mass.

The point is that the longterm viability of your privacy strategy on
Bitcoin depends at least in part upon the privacy of other people. KYC affects us all.
