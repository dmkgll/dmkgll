I used to think we don't have a gold standard anymore because gold failed. I thought Bitcoin would succeed where gold had failed
because Satoshi had programmed Bitcoin to succeed where gold had failed.

Then I thought about it for more than a second and realised I was wrong. I couldn't believe
how simple the real answer was. Here it is.

We don't have a gold standard because people tolerated not having a gold standard. I don't mean
they wanted it. I don't know what they wanted. For all I know, most people didn't even know anything about the gold standard or
government's ending it. I hope if they knew what they were giving up, they would have fought back 
harder. But however people felt, whatever they knew, they tolerated it.

This is an inconvienient answer for Bitcoiners. They like to believe that Bitcoin can't
go the way of gold because it is better than gold. I don't think it is better than gold but that doesn't matter. Bitcoin can
go the way of gold if people put up with the alternative. You can't code a shortcut. People are not code.
