### History of this site

#### Pre-online days

My dad registered "derekmagill.com" for me in the year 2000. I was seven years old. The domain sat and gathered digital dust for years.

#### Myspace era

I set up a Myspace in fourth grade, which in hindsight was young but my brother and his cool friends had one so I made one. None of my friends had them yet but I got to add all
of my brother's cute 7th grade girl friends so that was nice. "derekmagill.com" redirected to my Myspace at the time.

#### "Return to Reason" era

A blog set up by my friend Dale and I when we were both getting heavily into philosophy. We never did much on it. I think it was on blogspot? 

#### "Egode" era

The title comes from Ayn Rand's "Anthem." Egode is "ego + ode." Another blogspot blog set up by friends and I. I wrote a few articles on philosophy topics that are both cringe to look back on, and occasionally awe inspiring. I was pretty advanced for my age.

#### Graduation photos era

I was traveling for the summer and my parents wanted to send me photos from my high school graduation, so my dad thought it would be funny to host them all on derekmagill.com. A bit of light mockery from friends here and there was the worst I suffered.

#### Country Club Anarchist era

My friend Travis Mazer (RIP) used the title for years and passed it on to me. I wrote anarcho-capitalist political stuff and larped as a county club member.

#### derekmagill.com era 1.0

My first attempt at a blog right after I dropped out of college. I was just trying to copy Tim Ferris to be honest and I wasn't very good at it or consistent (I've seldom been consistent at blogging in my life). 

#### derekmagill.com Bitcoin Cash era

Incredible days. This blog became one of the most popular personal blogs in cryptocurrency, doing over $100,000 in tips in about a year and a half, and getting me opportunities to travel
all over the world to Bitcoin Cash conferences. Bitcoin Cash didn't work out like many of us hoped it would, so a lot of the writing 
feels outdated and insular, but it will always be one of the most exciting times of my life.

#### Dead era

Bad stuff happens in my personal life and I take several years off blogging.

#### Breaking Satoshi era

I started a new Bitcoin writing site focused less on insular social stuff and more on economics and history. It wasn't as popular
and I didn't do it for long, but several posts seem to have been incredibily influential and I laugh whenver I see someone discuss "the Makgill Curve."
To be honest, I wasn't ready to return to writing online and it showed. I gave it up after maybe twenty posts.

#### Experimental era

I spent way too much time trying to figure out what I wanted to build and write instead of just doing it and figuring it out along the way.

#### dmkgll.com (the current era)

Hopefully the mature, final iteration of a long process. The name is just my first initial and my last name without vowells. I added the 'K' because I prefer the original "Makgill" spelling to "Magill."

### Long site

I love Gwern Branwen's "[long site](https://www.gwern.net/About)." The idea is that you "work on projects that are too big to work on normally or too tedious." To that end, a lot of the pages and posts here will be evolving rather than static. Sometimes things will be published incomplete or in draft form and completed over time. 

I don't expect that most of what I write will stand the test of the time, but I like the question: "what would you work on if you wanted people 100 years from now to find it valuable? 500 years...1000?" I'm not the only person who has asked this, incidentally. Thucydides, writing in the 400s BC, said that his *History of the Peloponnesian War* was not written for an immediate audience, but it was done to last all time. Maybe that sounds arrogant but we are still reading him today. Obviously, you can't "know" what will happen to your work, but holding yourself to a higher standard than your average daily personal blog is a good start.
