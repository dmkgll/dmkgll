### History of this site

#### Pre-online days

My dad registered "derekmagill.com" for me in the year 2000. I was seven years old. The domain sat and gathered digital dust for years.

#### Myspace era

I set up a Myspace in fourth grade, which in hindsight was young but my brother and his cool friends had one so I made one. None of my friends had them yet but I got to add all
of my brother's cute 7th grade girl friends so that was nice. "derekmagill.com" redirected to my Myspace at the time.

#### "Return to Reason" era

A blog set up by my friend Dale and I when we were both getting heavily into philosophy. We never did much on it. I think it was on blogspot? 

#### "Egode" era

The title comes from Ayn Rand's "Anthem." Egode is "ego + ode." Another blogspot blog set up by friends and I. I wrote a few articles on philosophy topics that are both cringe to look back on, and occasionally awe inspiring. I was pretty advanced for my age.

#### Country Club Anarchist era

My friend Travis Mazer (RIP) used the title for years and passed it on to me. I wrote anarcho-capitalist political stuff and larped as a county club member.

#### derekmagill.com era 1.0

My first attempt at a blog right after I dropped out of college. I was just trying to copy Tim Ferris to be honest and I wasn't very good at it or consistent (I've seldom been consistent at blogging in my life). 

#### derekmagill.com Bitcoin Cash era

Incredible days. This blog became one of the most popular personal blogs in cryptocurrency, doing over $100,000 in tips in about a year and a half, and getting me opportunities to travel
all over the world to Bitcoin Cash conferences. Bitcoin Cash didn't work out like many of us hoped it would, so a lot of the writing 
feels outdated and insular, but it will always be one of the most exciting times of my life.

#### Dead era

Bad stuff happens in my personal life and I take several years off blogging.

#### Breaking Satoshi era

I started a new Bitcoin writing site focused less on insular social stuff and more on economics and history. It wasn't as popular
and I didn't do it for long, but several posts seem to have been incredibily influential and I laugh whenver I see someone discuss "the Makgill Curve."
To be honest, I wasn't ready to return to writing online and it showed. I gave it up after maybe twenty posts.

#### Experimental era

I spent way too much time trying to figure out what I wanted to build and write instead of just doing it and figuring it out along the way.

#### dmkgll.com (the current era)

Hopefully the mature, final iteration of a long process. The name is just my first initial and my last name without vowells. I added the 'K' because I prefer the original "Makgill" spelling to "Magill."
