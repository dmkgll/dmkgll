title: final bitcoin conclusion
---

The funny thing about supporting Bitcoin's original scaling model is that if you're correct, you have to concede that Bitcoin is not 
as great as you've believed. Consider what it means to be a "big blocker." It means you believe that Bitcoin was designed
to operate one way but that it was corrupted by a small community of devs, companies, cultists and trolls who turned it
against its original purpose as ecash into a useless "number go up" token.

But what makes Bitcoin great, or what we believed made Bitcoin great, was that it was uncorruptibleâ€”outside the influence of social and
political forces that might want to harm it. Clearly this is not true if you accept the view of history, as I do, that
Bitcoin was neutered and perverted to the point where it no longer resembles at all what Satoshi Nakamoto originally created. Bitcoin
is not incorruptible or outside of the influence of government, special interests, or the unwashed masses. If an army of social media trolls could convince or bully people
into ruining the "greatest monetary invention of all time," then obviously it is not the greatest monetary invention of all time or you need
to seriously reevaulate and redefine why it is instead of repeating tired old lines from 2014 and 2015 about Bitcoin's
revolutionary, libertarian implications, which are demonstrably false under our narrative of events.

It is amusing then that the same person who will say something like "we won't let Bitcoin Cash (or Bitcoin SV or [insert coin here]) 
get ruined because we know what to look out for this time" will also say something like "Bitcoin Cash is decentralized, immutable, uncorruptible and
is going to destroy governments around the world... blah blah blah." The two beliefs are completely at odds with eachother. The first statement implies the second is false because it suggests Bitcoin security is a social phenomenon and needs the right, honest people with good ideas in order to remain pure.

The thing is, if you are a big blocker, you have to conclude that Bitcoin does essentially require this because bad actors with bad ideas can influence Bitcoin. "Bitcoin doesn't care" and "code is law" are mythologies created by the people who are currently in charge of Bitcoin. People write the code and run it, and its really not your node or your hashpower or the code that stop
it from turning into something you don't want it to be, it's people. If people want a Bitcoin that is inflated beyond 21 million coins,
or if they can be bought or forced by the state to "want it," then that's what will happen. If they want a block size hard limit of 12mb, that' what will happen.  It's not
something that exists outside the people who run the code. It's just software that can be changed at any time if people come to believe
that change is necessary. And it doesn't even require the majority of people to do this. It just requires the majority of people to be indifferent to
or tolerant of this change, or locked out of a Github repo. When Bitcoin was prevented from scaling beyond 1mb blocks, it wasn't because most people wanted that. Most 
people didn't want that. But it happpened anyway.

Again, if you acccept the big block Bitcoin version of history, this is the only conclusion. Bitcoin is not what we thought it was. It's not going to kill fiat. It *is* fiat. The same problems
that turned Bitcoin against itself in the past will come up again and again because there is nothing technical in Bitcoin's design that stops it. It's just people.

So where do we go from here? I don't know. I still think there is a lot of value in micropayments and public ledgers, but part of what got me so excited about Bitcoin was the idea of having money outside of human control. If I'm being honest, this was a blindspot for me. Wishful thinking. It was probably never true in the past and it is definitely not true now.
