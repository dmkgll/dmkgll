title: final bitcoin conclusion
---

The problem with supporting Bitcoin's original scaling model is that if you're correct, you have to concede that Bitcoin is not 
as great as you've believed. Consider what it means to be a "big blocker." It means you believe that Bitcoin was designed
to operate one way but that it was corrupted by a small community of devs, companies, cultists and trolls who turned it
against its original purpose as ecash into a useless "number go up" token.

But what makes Bitcoin great, or what we believed made Bitcoin great, was that it was uncorruptibleâ€”outside the influence of social and
political forces that might want to harm it. Clearly this is not true if you accept the view of history, as I do, that
Bitcoin was neutered and perverted to the point where it no longer resembles at all what Satoshi Nakamoto originally created. Bitcoin
is not incorruptible or outside of the influence of government, special interests, or unwashed masses. If an army of social media trolls could convince or bully people
into ruining the "greatest monetary invention of all time," then obviously it is not the greatest monetary invention of all time or you need
to seriously reevaulate and redefine why it is instead of repeating tired old lines from 2014 and 2015 about Bitcoin's
revolutionary, libertarian implications, which are demonstrably false under our narrative of events.

It has always struck me as kind of funny and cringe that the same person who will say something like "we won't let Bitcoin Cash 
get ruined because we know what to look out for this time" will also say something like "Bitcoin Cash is decentralized, immutable, and
is going to destroy governments around the world... blah blah blah." The two beliefs are completely at odds with eachother. If you believe that
keeping Bitcoin uncorrupted requires an army of trusted watchdogs stopping people from screwing with things, then you implicitly
accept that Bitcoin is NOT uncorruptible.

The thing is, Bitcoin does require this. Humans write the code and run it, and its not your node or your hashpower or the code that stop
it from turning into something you don't want it to be, it's people. If people want a Bitcoin that is inflated beyond 21 million coins,
or if they can be bought or forced by the state to "want it," then that's what will happen. Bitcoin is not immune to bad actors and bad ideas. It's not
something that exists outside the people who run the code. It's just software that can be changed at any time if people come to believe
that change is necessary. And it doesn't require the majority of people to do this. It just requires the majority of people to be indifferent to
or tolerant of this change. When Bitcoin was prevented from scaling beyond 1mb blocks, it wasn't because most people wanted that. Most 
people didn't want that. But it happpened anyway.

Again, if you acccept the big block Bitcoin version of history, this is the only conclusion. Bitcoin is not what we thought it was.  Its immutability is a myth. Maybe
that's enough. Maybe as long as people believe that myth it can be kept safe.
