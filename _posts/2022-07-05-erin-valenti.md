title: The Strange Death of Erin Valenti
---

## Death

Agnes Valenti's phone rang. It was her daughter, Erin. Erin was on a business trip after attending a conference by an obscure professional development
organisation called Ontocore. She wasn't talking much sense. "It's all a game, it's a thought experiment, we're in the Matrix," said Erin. Eventually she hung up. Anges
tried to contact her again and again but got no answer. Five days later, police found her daughter's body in the back of her rental car in a suburb off the path of her trip. The cause of death? "Accute manic episode."

## Conspiracy

The strange circumstances of Erin's death have been fuel for conspiracy theorists in the years since, with many believing that she was 
murdered because she discovered that we really are living in a digital simulation. r/conspiracy on Reddit has been a popular place of discussion and a 
few people have pointed to the professional development seminar she supposedly attended just days before her death as being worthy of investigation.
