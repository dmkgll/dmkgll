title: The Strange Death of Erin Valenti
---

## Death

Agnes Valenti's phone rang. It was her daughter, Erin. Erin was on a business trip after attending a conference by an obscure professional development
organisation called Ontocore. She wasn't talking much sense. "It's all a game, it's a thought experiment, we're in the Matrix," said Erin. Eventually she hung up. Anges
tried to contact her again and again but got no answer. Five days later, police found her daughter's body in the back of her rental car in a suburb off the path of her trip. The cause of death? "Accute manic episode."

## Conspiracy

The strange circumstances of Erin's death have been fuel for conspiracy theorists in the years since, with many believing that she was 
murdered because she discovered that we really are living in a digital simulation. r/conspiracy on Reddit has been a popular place of discussion and a 
few people have pointed to the professional development seminar she supposedly attended just days before her death as being worthy of investigation. 

For my own part, I don't believe we live in the Matrix or that Erin had some dangerous knowledge she was about to break to the world. But I think this program she attended, Ontocore, ought to have gotten a lot more scrutiny.

## Ontocore

The first time I crossed paths with one of the co-founders of what would become Ontocore was in 2014. I had just started my first job at a startup out of college. I remember the founder told me he had met with someone who had told him he was a kind of business coach. The guy had taken him into his home and put on a show of his wealth and success, then asked him to give him something like $100,000 to "coach" our startup. He turned him down, *obviously,* and we all had a good laugh about it later. This guy seemed like a mostly harmless (if you know the schtick and aren't dazzled) douchebag guru type who wanted to latch on to our company while it was young.

I didn't hear from him again for several years and only thought of him very rarely when I was recounting the funny story. I didn't know at the time, but this guy hadn't given up. Odd coincidences where he happened to show up at the same coffee shop as our founder, making relationships with some of our customers who would then reach out to people on our team about him, all happened without my knowledge. I can't speak to most of it because that's not my story to tell.

Around 2016 or 2017, we got invited to this professional development seminar in Phoenix called Ontocore. Or rather, our founder was invited but he decided to send three of the team in his place (I only later found out how hard they tried to convince him to come without us). It seemed really cheesy and if I had known at the time that the same guy from 2014, Mr. Guru douchebag, was invovlved, I would have never agreed to go. But our founder thought it was a good opportunity for us to build some possible partnerships since he had been promised there would be a lot of successful business owners there.

Apparently we were sent some material to read and review before the seminar but I never saw it (or I probably woudn't have gone). I flew to Phoenix.
