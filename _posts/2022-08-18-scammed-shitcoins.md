title: "How You're Being Scammed into Buying Shitcoins (Edition #1 of ∞)"
---

Here's a trick you can use the next time some flashy zoomer with a bird's nest and veneers tries to tell you to buy
their crypto token on YouTube: read the comments.

The other day I came across this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v6rKsp6yJM) for no reason at all (seriously why is YouTube promoting this to me?) and the term
"DeSo" (decentralized social media) sounded so ridiculous to me I had to watch. Given the fact that the guys in the video
have no idea what they are talking about, are obviously getting some kind of kickback to promote this crap, and are speaking about the coin in such a way that would probably land a licensed stock advisor in jail, I was surprised
by just how many comments the video seemed to have. 

Do people actually like this nonsense? Probably. People paying small fortunes like cartoon ape jpegs.

Still, the comments tell an interesting story.

> *THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING YOU GUYS DO ITS A BLESSING GOOD LUCK ON THE CAR GIVEAWAY TO EVERYONE WHO ENTERED.*
>
>*I need a car but congratulations  to whoever  wins hope it goes to someone who really needs it instead of ppl just wanting  a car   but hey god bless everyone.*
>
>*They are truly very talented people, I admire what they are still achieving, hopefully at some point I will be like you 🔑❤️🍀🤑*
>
>*Thank you HighKey Clout For This Info 🤘🏽💯❤️😇 You Guys ROCK!*

Almost every comment is like this, that is, vaccuous fawning that has nothing to do with the video and everything to do with some giveway.

What the hell, right? Well it turns out the "activity" and the "excitement" for this coin on this video are all fake. The comments? A requirement to enter their giveaway. The views? Probably fake too. But as long as you don't look too closely, it's got the appearance of genuine hype that you *just.don't.want.to.miss.out.on.*

At least they put a warning in their description to beware of scammers. But they should have included themselves in that warning.
