title: a short story sketch
---

I have an idea for a short story. Maybe it's called *Terms of Service.* You'll see why, though it could also be called
*Smart* or *Disconnected.*

I would like to begin with the classic ["the year was 2081"](https://www.tnellen.com/cybereng/harrison.html) but I 
think that is unbelievable because the things that happen in this short story are coming much sooner than that.

So...let's pick an arbitrary safe date.

The year is 2033. John is an average normie with a good life somewhere in the USa. We meet him as he has just woken up and is walking downstairs on what appears to be a normal morning.

The first sign that this is *not* a normal morning is that his smart, wi-fi enabled Keurig machine which he uses to make his morning
coffee every day won't work. It's not broken though. It turns on. It's just that the screen flashes a notice he has never seen before. It says *TOS Violation - Please see email for more details on reactivating your device.*

*What the hell?* John thinks to himself. *How can you violate the terms of a Keurig machine?*

He grabs his phone to check his email but he can't get in. It's not broken either. *TOS Violation. Your phone has been locked until the required steps are completed. Do you wish to continue?"

*This is ridiculous,* says John aloud. He decides it's probably a software issue and that he is going to take a shower and head out to get coffee before going to the Apple store.

John goes back upstairs and before he goes to the bathroom, he tries to adjust the thermostat. *TOS Violation...*

Now he's worried. He runs downstairs to check his other smart devices, which are, frankly, almost every appliance and utility in the house. His fridge, his clock, his automated vaccuum cleaner. 
*the fucking ceiling fan and lightbulbs,* thinks John.

All of them say basically the same thing. John has been locked out due to a terms of service violaton and he will need to complete certain steps
to regain access to his devices.

John picks his phone back up. *Would you like to continue?* 

*Yes.*

The phone walks him through an explanation of the violation. Apparently a Tweet John had made the previous evening violated their rules for "user civic integrity and responsibility," and also fell under the category of "hate speech." In order to get
his phone to work again, John would need to complete a required training course on why what he said was wrong.

*Screw this,* he says. He grabs his car key and goes to his garage and... his Tesla is gone. It drove itself back to the factory
on its own because it too had a TOS that stated the type of Tweet John made was unacceptable. 

He tries to open his garage. It won't open.

He tries to open his front door. It won't open.

John doesn't know this, but the smart security cameras he has installed are now filming him and streaming it per their terms of service that allow them to dox violators of their policies to the internet.

As the horror of his situation dawns on him, John hears an somewhat artificial female voice in the background...*John, it's Alexa. We need to talk about your Tweet last night.*
