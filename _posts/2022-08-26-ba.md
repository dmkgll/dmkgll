I was walking through the bookstore the other day and had this hilarious idea. Somebody, not me, should take a dozen or so of the most controversial books of all time and place them on the "read banned books" table at the store on top of the copies of *To Kill a Mockingbird*, *A Handmaid's Tale,* *Harry Potter,* *1984,* and all the other uncontroversial books on the display. It would be very funny to test people's commitment to "reading banned books" when they are asked to read books that are actually dangerous.

Then I thought, does there exist a list of truly controversail, scandelous books which have been banned from mainstream stores? I don't know, but I couldnt' find one so I made it.

<div align="CENTER">
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="80%">
 <tbody><tr>
 <td bgcolor="#000000">
 <table border="0" cellpadding="16" cellspacing="0" width="100%">

<td bgcolor="#FFFFDD">

 <p> This is a controversial page. If you have a problem with it, please understand...

 </p><p>
</p><ol>
<li> <i>I don't care. I can't stress this enough. I don't care. It's not that I don't care about your feelings. It's just that I don't care about these particular feelings.</i></li>
           
 <li> <i>Restricting the books on this page to "books I endorse" would defeat the purpose. The point is to feature books I don't endorse.</i></li>

<li> There is nothing you can do to make me take it down. Report me, cancel me, threaten me. See above. I just don't care.</li>

<ul>
 <li> You can ignore this page.
