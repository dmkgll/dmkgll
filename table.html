<div class="page__content">
					<p>Now including all of season 7B. This may be the final significant update of the Futurama timeline. It's been an emotional day for me.</p>

<h3 id="sec0">Notes</h3>
<ul>
	<li><p>The Futurama universe is assumed to be exactly identical to ours except where the show explicitly diverges from reality.</p></li>
	<li><p>Several episodes' dates are formed based on projections which may prove unreliable. For example, "Put Your Head On My Shoulder" can be firmly dated to 14th February only if Valentine's Day doesn't get moved over the next thousand years, and "That's Lobstertainment!" features the 1074th Academy Awards, which places it in 3002 only if no Oscar ceremonies are cancelled.</p></li>
	<li><p>Except where stated (and where direct contradictions arise), it is assumed that production order of episodes is the same as chronological order.</p></li>
	<li><p>The events of the episodes "The Why Of Fry", "Bender's Big Score", "All The Presidents' Heads" and "Decision 3012" resulted in changes to the Futurama timeline. This timeline deals solely with the <em>final timeline to date</em>. There are other timelines in which events played out differently, which no longer apply to current Futurama continuity.</p></li>
	<li><p>"The Futurama Holiday Spectacular", "Reincarnation", "Naturama" and "Saturday Morning Fun Pit" are not canon.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sec1">The Timeline</h3>
<p>A question mark indicates that a date is probable, but not known for definite. A tilde (~) indicates that the date is approximate.</p>

				<p>During this episode, Bender travels back to 1351 BCE, 1509 CE, 2308 CE, and many other eras, retrieving priceless treasures and bringing them to the present day. Many of his trips (e.g. acquiring the sarcophagus of pharaoh Amenhotep III and the 2308 Nobel Peace Prize) fulfill established history because the treasures in question are lost to history; however, equally many (the Mona Lisa, Vincent van Gogh's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Van_Gogh_Self-Portrait_Autumn_1887.jpg">Self-portrait of Autumn 1887</a>) result in the creation of doomed time paradox duplicates of the artifacts in question. All these duplicates are destroyed by the end of the episode, however, resolving the paradoxes. Bender's head is already 1045 years older than his body due to the events of "Roswell That Ends Well", but during this episode his head and body both accrue a grand total of more than a hundred thousand years of additional age.</p>
