I spent today reading about mega-long-term engineering
projects. I'd read about most of this stuff years ago, but I checked it
out again because of a recent 
<a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/05/11/011235">
<b>Slashdot</b></a> article about the plan to come up with a way to decorate
the nuclear <a href="toxic.html">waste</a> depositories in the desert
with messages that will still be understandable in 10,000 years.
Keeping in mind that the whole of recorded history only stretches back
6-8,000 years.  The 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020607215609/http%3A//www.salon.com/people/feature/2002/05/10/yucca_mountain/index.html">
<b>Salon</b></a> article that prompted the Slashdot reference was
idiotic: the bozo writing it obviously didn't actually <i>read</i>
anything about the project, and chose to just make fun of it based on
his preconceptions and what little some PR flack told him over the
phone.

Anyway, there are some excerpts from the report 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20011128114952/http%3A//www.halcyon.com/blackbox/hw/wipp/wipp.html"><b>here</b></a>:
I don't think I'd seen this level of detail before. (The full PDF
report is 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080516200913/http%3A//infoserve.sandia.gov/sand_doc/1992/921382.pdf">
<b>here</b></a>.)

 This place is not a place of honor.<br>
 No highly esteemed deed is commemorated here.<br>
 Nothing valued is here.<br>
 This place is a message and part of a system of messages.<br>
 Pay attention to it!<br>
 Sending this message was important to us.<br>
 We considered ourselves to be a powerful culture.

Some of the designs are genuinely spooky.  It's really interesting
reading: neat potential solutions to a really hard problem: how do you
communicate with someone who may know nothing of your language or
iconography?  Who might assume that your spooky-faces are there because
you are hiding treasure?

There's more about this in Gregory Benford's 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20011017183657/http%3A//www.physics.uci.edu/~silverma/benford.html"><b>Deep
Time</b></a>: he was a part of the group brainstorming about these ideas,
and goes into more detail.  (Beware of the weird duplication: whoever
put that document up had a weird cut-and-paste mishap or two in the
middle.)

A history of media, from prehistory to now: 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20011222155930/http%3A//www.mediahistory.umn.edu/time/prehist.html"><b>Media
History Project</b></a>.  (No wonder it's so hard to write floppies for 
this <a href="dali.html">old Mac</a>...)

On a less depressing topic, there's the 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010809171317/http%3A//www.longnow.org/10kclock/clkPurpose.htm"><b>10,000 Year
Clock</b></a>: a giant clock that will keep correct time for 10KY, ticking
once a year.  Because they can, and because nobody builds to last.  I
first read this page in 1995

<blockquote><i>When I was a kid, three decades ago, the future was a long way so was the turn of the millennium. Dates like 1984 and 2001
were comfortably remote.  But the funny thing is, that in all these years, the future that people think about has not moved past the
 millennium.  It's as if the future has been shrinking one year, per and 2030 is too far away to even think about.  Why bother making plans when everything will change?</i></blockquote>  

That really rang true: even four or five years before the millennium, the catch-phrase of the talking heads on TV was still by
the year 2000...  Are we in the future yet?  Have we passed that
asymptote?  Well, they've built the first version of the 
clock, and are working on a larger one...

And I think this is the third time I've linked to this one in the
last couple of months, but it's been on my mind: one of my favorite
rants ever, 

<blockquote><i>
Say to these annoying people, Hey kids - the past wasn't like a
 trip to Waikiki: the only sure thing about the past is some
ghastly disease, carnage, toil that defies all description,
 starvation, and boredom of a sort that makes waiting in line at
the Department of Motor Vehicles seem like Disneyland on heroin.</i></blockquote>  

From the folks who brought you the clock,
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030105011347/http%3A//www.rosettaproject.org/live/disk"><b>The Rosetta
Project</b></a> is trying to build a modern Rosetta Stone, preserving
samples of the same texts in a thousand languages on an object that
will last thousands of years.  It's a really nifty design: the text
begins at the outside rim of the disk, and quickly shrinks as it
spirals inward, until it is microscopic.  Which is an example of the
kind of implicit communication these kinds of projects have to do: the
shape of it says there is more here, get a magnifier to see it. If
it was all small, nobody would have noticed!  But even without
recognizing any of the letters, you can tell what's going on.

Reading about engineering things to last millennia gave me another
nerdy thought.  I'm a fan of the TV series Stargate SG-1'', whose
villains are a parasitic alien race who live tens of thousands of
years, and like to impersonate gods.  Even though they have FTL travel,
they tend to build things out of stone, using armies of human
slaves.  And after reading about the difficulties of truly long-term
engineering, that starts to make a lot more sense!

This last one is just strange: 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020124122641/http%3A//www.unmuseum.org/oakisl.htm"><b>The Mystery Pit of Oak
Island</b></a>: something was buried in a booby-trapped pit at least 160'
deep hundreds of years ago, and over the centuries, a number of people
have died trying to dig it up.

Somewhere in one of the above documents, someone used a phrase like
the abyss of time and when I read about the Oak Island pit, I saw
it as an analogy for the march of history: looking back at our own past
over these vast spans of time is like trying to see into the murky
depths of some un-plumbable pit.  And if you think about constructing
things to last thousands of years, you can't help but realize that
<i>you</i> are down in that pit, and more muck is being piled on top of
it <i>forever</i>.  And you're trying to make something that glistens
just enough that people up at ground level can see it: until they too
get buried in the ever-darkening muck.

I think it was Woody Allen who said, I don't want to achieve
immortality through my work.  I want to achieve immortality through not
dying.''
